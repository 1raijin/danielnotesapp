This is a simple web-based note-taking project built using React JS and Vite. The application allows users to interactively create, edit, and delete notes, and these notes are stored using session storage.

### How to Use the Application 🚀

To use this application, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies** 📦
   Make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer. If not, you can download it from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

   npm install

   Once Node.js is installed, open the terminal and navigate to the project directory. Then, run the following command to install all the required dependencies:


2. **Run the Application** ▶️
After all the dependencies are installed, you can run the application with the following command:

   npm run dev

The application will run on `http://localhost:3000`. Open your browser and access that address.

3. **Using the Application** 📓
- You will see the application interface containing an initially empty list of notes.
- To add a new note, click the "Add Note" button at the top.
- To edit a note, click on the note you want to edit, make changes, and click the "Save" button.
- To delete a note, click the "Delete" button on the note you want to remove.

4. **Save Notes Using Session Storage** 💾
- The notes you create will be saved using your browser's session storage. This means these notes will only be available during your browsing session. When you close the browser or refresh the page, the notes will persist.

### Project Structure 📂

The project structure consists of several directories and main files:

- `src/`: This directory contains the application's source code.
- `components/`: This directory contains React components used in the application, such as `NoteList`, `NoteForm`, and others.
- `App.js`: This file is the main component that manages the application's display and logic.
- `index.html`: The main HTML file of the application.
- `main.js`: The main JavaScript file that initializes the React application.
- `vite.config.js`: The Vite configuration file.

### Additional Notes 📌

This application only stores notes in the browser's session storage, so the notes will be lost when you close the browser or open the page in a different tab. To permanently save notes, you can integrate the application with a backend and database.
